# ODE_Projekt_TimeTracker

The **TimeTracker** is a Java application that allows employees to record their working hours.  
Each employee can create different tasks and log time spent working on them.  
A time entry is created by starting a timer, working, and then stopping the timer.  
The recorded time is assigned to a task and saved.

The application consists of:

- a **Client**, which provides the user interface  
- a **Server**, which acts as the central data storage  

The client sends all recorded working times to the server via a **TCP connection**,  
where the server stores the data persistently.
